      <description>Outliers and violation of distributional assumptions are common in many area of research. These issues might introduce substantial bias in the analysis and potentially lead to grossly incorrect inference. Traditionally, outliers are identified through manual inspection of the data; violation of normality are often addressed by data transformation. Other forms of assumption violation, such as heterogeneity in variance, can be more challenging to address. Robust regression is a technique that can reduce the impact of outliers and other forms of assumption violations.</description>

      <title>Causal Mediation Analysis</title>

      <description>Mediation analysis is a technique that examines the intermediate process by which the indepedent variable affects the dependent variable. For example, family intervention during adolescence (independent variable) can reduce engagement with deviant peer group (mediator) and their experimentation with drugs, which in turn reduce risk of substance use disorder in young adulthood (dependent variable).
StatsNotebook uses the cutting edge counterfactual framework and Monte Carlo technique to conduct causal mediation analysis. It can handle</description>

      <title>Multiple Imputation</title>

      <description>Missing data is a norm rather than an exception in most area of research. Excluding observations with missing data reduces statistical power and potentially introduces bias in model estimates. Multiple imputation is a technique that fills in missing value based on available data. It can increase statistical power and reduce bias due to missing data.
StatsNotebook provides a simple interface for multiple imputation using the mice package. By default, numeric variables are imputed using predictive mean matching and categorical variables are imputed using multinomial logistic regression (for categorical variables with 3 or more level) or binary logistic regression (for categorical variables with 2 levels).</description>

      <title>Moderation (Interaction) analysis using linear regression</title>

      <description>Assumed knowledge in this tutorial: Linear regression
Moderation analysis is used to examine if the effect of an independent variable on the dependent variable is the same across different level of another independent variable (moderator). In an other word, it is for examining if the moderator change the strength of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
Example research questions  Is the effect of psychotherapy (independent variable) on depression (dependent variable) stronger for female than for male (moderator: sex)?</description>

      <description>Correlogram is a type of chart that visualise the pairwise association between variables. StatsNotebook uses the ggpairs() function from the GGally library to build correlogram. A publication ready correlogram can be built within a few minutes with StatsNotebook.
We use the built-in Personality dataset in this example. This dataset can be loaded into StatsNotebook using instruction here or can be downloaded from here.
In this example, we will build a simple correlogram to visualise the relationship between four variables (three personality variables: Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, Openness and one mental health variable: Depression).</description>

      <description>This tutorial will give a short introduction on descriptive analysis using StatsNotebook. Descriptive statistcs such as mean, standard deviation, median and interquartile range can be easily obtained using the Explore panel.
We use the built-in Personality dataset in this example. This dataset can be loaded into StatsNotebook using instruction here or can be downloaded from here.
The Personality dataset contains data from 231 participants, with measures on the Big 5 personality factors (Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, neuroticism and Openness), three measures of mental health (Depression, Trait anxiety and State anxiety).</description>

      <title>Set reference for categorical variables</title>

      <description>For categorical variable, it is important to set a &amp;ldquo;reference&amp;rdquo; category for categorical variable in many analyses. For example, for the variable Sex in our regression analysis tutorial, the default reference is Female. The coefficient of SexMale from the regression represents the effect of male relative to female. In this case, the coefficient -0.87 means that the depression score (the dependent variable in that analysis) for male is 0.87 lower than female.</description>

      <title>Linear Regression</title>

      <description>Linear regression is a technique for examining the relationship between a dependent variable (outcome) and a set of independent variables (predictors). This tutorial demonstrates how to conduct a linear regression in StatsNotebook using the following example. We will also provide an example write-up in APA styles.
Example research questions  Are the Big 5 personality traits, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Openness, associated with depression? Is sex associated with depression?  In this setup, the dependent variable is depression, the independent variables are Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Neuroticism, Openness and sex.</description>

      <title>Linear regression with missing data</title>

      <description>In many area of research, missing data is a norm rather than an exception. Dropping observations/ participants with missing data is usually not appropriate as it reduces statistical power and also may introduce bias in analysis. This tutorial will demonstrate a simple way in StatsNotebook to handle missing data using multiple imputation.
In our linear regression tutorial, we use the personality dataset to examine two research qeustions.
 Are the Big 5 personality traits, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Openness, associated with depression?</description>
