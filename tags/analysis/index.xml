      <description>Data with multilevel (hierarchical) structure are common in many area of research. In our tutorial on moderation analysis, we examine the impact of increasing alcohol tax in Queensland on alcohol consumption. We compared changes in alcohol consumption for individuals from Queensland before and after the implementation of tax increase, compared to changes in alcohol consumption in other states. The data were collected from individuals from different postcodes in different states. Therefore, individual observations are nested within postcodes.</description>

      <title>Residual plots and assumption checking</title>

      <description>A residual plot is an essential tool for checking the assumption of linearity and homoscedasticity. The following are examples of residual plots when (1) the assumptions are met, (2) the homoscedasticity assumption is violated and (3) the linearity assumption is violated.
Assumption met When both the assumption of linearity and homoscedasticity are met, the points in the residual plot (plotting standardised residuals against predicted values) will be randomly scattered.
Heteroscedasticity When the homoscedasticity assumption is violated, the &amp;ldquo;spread&amp;rdquo; of the points across predicted values are not the same.</description>

      <description>Outliers and violation of distributional assumptions are common in many area of research. These issues might introduce substantial bias in the analysis and potentially lead to grossly incorrect inferences. Traditionally, outliers are identified through manual inspection of the data; violatiosn of normality are often addressed by data transformation. Other forms of assumption violations, such as heterogeneity in variance, can be more challenging to address. Robust regression is a technique that can reduce the impact of outliers and other forms of assumption violations.</description>

      <description>Mediation analysis is a technique that examines the intermediate process by which the independent variable affects the dependent variable. For example, family intervention during adolescence (independent variable) can reduce engagement with deviant peer group (mediator) and their experimentation with drugs, which in turn reduces risk of substance use disorder in young adulthood (dependent variable).
StatsNotebook uses the cutting-edge counterfactual framework and Monte Carlo technique to conduct causal mediation analysis. It can handle</description>

      <title>Multiple Imputation</title>

      <description>Missing data is a norm rather than an exception in most area of research. Excluding observations with missing data reduces statistical power and potentially introduces bias in model estimates. Multiple imputation is a technique that fills in missing value based on the available data. It can increase statistical power and reduce bias due to missing data.
StatsNotebook provides a simple interface for multiple imputation using the mice package. By default, numeric variables are imputed using predictive mean matching and categorical variables are imputed using multinomial logistic regression (for categorical variables with 3 or more level) or binary logistic regression (for categorical variables with 2 levels).</description>

      <title>Moderation (Interaction) analysis using linear regression</title>

      <description>Assumed knowledge in this tutorial: Linear regression
Moderation analysis is used to examine if the effect of an independent variable on the dependent variable is the same across different levels of another independent variable (moderator). In an other words, it is use to examine whether the moderator change the strength of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
Example research questions  Is the effect of psychotherapy (independent variable) on depression (dependent variable) stronger for females than for males (moderator: sex)?</description>

      <description>This tutorial will give a short introduction on descriptive analysis using StatsNotebook. Descriptive statistcs such as mean, standard deviation, median and interquartile range can be easily obtained using the Explore panel.
We use the built-in Personality dataset in this example. This dataset can be loaded into StatsNotebook using the instructions provided here or can be downloaded from here.
The Personality dataset contains data from 231 participants, with measures on the Big 5 personality factors (Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Neuroticism and Openness), and three measures of mental health (Depression, Trait anxiety and State anxiety).</description>

      <description>Linear regression is a technique for examining the relationship between a dependent variable (outcome) and a set of independent variables (predictors). This tutorial demonstrates how to conduct a linear regression in StatsNotebook using the following example. We will also provide an example write-up in APA style.
Example research questions  Are the Big 5 personality traits, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Openness, associated with depression? Is sex associated with depression? (i.</description>

      <description>In many area of research, missing data is a norm rather than an exception. Dropping observations/ participants with missing data is usually not appropriate as it reduces statistical power and also may introduce bias in analysis. This tutorial will demonstrate a simple way in StatsNotebook to handle missing data using multiple imputation.
In our linear regression tutorial, we use the personality dataset to examine two research qeustions.
 Are the Big 5 personality traits, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Openness, associated with depression?</description>
