      <description>Outliers and violation of distributional assumptions are common in many area of research. These issues might introduce substantial bias in the analysis and potentially lead to grossly incorrect inference. Traditionally, outliers are identified through manual inspection of the data; violation of normality are often addressed by data transformation. Other forms of assumption violation, such as heterogeneity in variance, can be more challenging to address. Robust regression is a technique that can reduce the impact of outliers and other forms of assumption violations.</description>

      <title>Causal Mediation Analysis</title>

      <description>Mediation analysis is a technique that examines the intermediate process by which the indepedent variable affects the dependent variable. For example, family intervention during adolescence (independent variable) can reduce engagement with deviant peer group (mediator) and their experimentation with drugs, which in turn reduce risk of substance use disorder in young adulthood (dependent variable).
StatsNotebook uses the cutting edge counterfactual framework and Monte Carlo technique to conduct causal mediation analysis. It can handle</description>

      <title>Moderation (Interaction) analysis using linear regression</title>

      <description>Assumed knowledge in this tutorial: Linear regression
Moderation analysis is used to examine if the effect of an independent variable on the dependent variable is the same across different level of another independent variable (moderator). In an other word, it is for examining if the moderator change the strength of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
Example research questions Is the effect of psychotherapy (independent variable) on depression (dependent variable) stronger for female than for male (moderator: sex)?</description>

      <title>Linear Regression</title>

      <description>Linear regression is a technique for examining the relationship between a dependent variable (outcome) and a set of independent variables (predictors). This tutorial demonstrates how to conduct a linear regression in StatsNotebook using the following example. We will also provide an example write-up in APA styles.
Example research questions Are the Big 5 personality traits, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Openness, associated with depression? Is sex associated with depression?  In this setup, the dependent variable is depression, the independent variables are Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Neuroticism, Openness and sex.</description>

      <title>Linear regression with missing data</title>
      <link>http://gckc123.github.io/blog/analysis/regression_missingdata/</link>

      <description>In many area of research, missing data is a norm rather than an exception. Dropping observations/ participants with missing data is usually not appropriate as it reduces statistical power and also may introduce bias in analysis. This tutorial will demonstrate a simple way in StatsNotebook to handle missing data using multiple imputation.
In our linear regression tutorial, we use the personality dataset to examine two research qeustions.
 Are the Big 5 personality traits, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Openness, associated with depression?</description>
