In multiwave longitudinal study, the exposure is often time-varying. A time varying confounder is a time varying variable that is affected by previous exposures, and also affect future exposure and outcome, thus confounding the relationship between the exposure and the outcome. Time varying confounding is common in longitudinal research. When evaluating the relationship between a time-varying exposure and outcome, standard methods such as regression and generalised linear models produce biased estimates in the presence of time-varying confounders.</description>

This is a follow-up tutorial built on our tutorial on inverse probability treatment weight. In this tutorial, we use the same example, but with some missing data in the dataset. It is recommended that you read our tutorial on inverse probability treatment weight first.
The example data can be downloaded from here.
If your dataset has missing data, multiple imputation can be firstly used to impute the missing value.</description>

About this workshop Adjusting for time-varying confounders using IPTW for causal inference Randomized controlled trial is the gold standard for causal inference yet it is not always feasible. Multi-wave longitudinal data is increasingly used for causal inference. Standard methods such as regression yield biased results in the presence of time-varying confounders. In this workshop, I will demonstrate using Inverse probability treatment weight (IPTW) and marginal structural model (MSM) to adjust for time-varying confounders.</description>

      <title>Causal Mediation Analysis</title>

Mediation analysis is a technique that examines the intermediate process by which the independent variable affects the dependent variable. For example, family intervention during adolescence (independent variable) can reduce engagement with deviant peer group (mediator) and their experimentation with drugs, which in turn reduces risk of substance use disorder in young adulthood (dependent variable).
StatsNotebook uses the cutting-edge counterfactual framework and Monte Carlo technique to conduct causal mediation analysis.</description>
